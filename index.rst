Check_MK Documentation
======================

Welcome to the Check_MK documentation. The official check_mk documentation is
available at the following link http://mathias-kettner.com/checkmk.html.

The documentation provided here is a personal effort to provide documentation
for the commercial check_mk monitoring system however the majority of the
information here should apply to the open source versions as well.

If you find mistakes or feel you could contribute in helping us provide better documentation please feel free to dive in by visiting `this github page`_.
